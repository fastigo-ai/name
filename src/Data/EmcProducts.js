Harmonics’ as defined by EMC standards refers to harmonics of the 50 or 60Hz mains supply that are imposed on the current drawn from the supply by the product. Many  products impose a non-linear load on the mains which results in current being taken for only part of the voltage cycle. The result is that power is taken at higher ‘harmonic’ frequencies for which the mains distribution is not designed. Even though the amount created by each product may be small, the overall effect of many 1,000s on the local electricity supply network can affect the reliability of the supply network.`,
